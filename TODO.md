# Compiler/Interpreter Implementation

- [ ] Complete `token.zig` with all lexical token definitions
- [ ] Implement `lexer.zig` to properly tokenize lexica syntax
- [ ] Develop `ast.zig` with node structures for all language features
- [ ] Build `parser.zig` to create correct AST from tokens
- [ ] Implement `environment.zig` for variable scope management
- [ ] Create `evaluator.zig` to execute parsed program statements
- [ ] Develop `builtins.zig` with standard library functions
- [ ] Enhance `error.zig` with descriptive, user-friendly error messages

---

# Testing

- [ ] Write comprehensive lexer tests in `lexer_tests.zig`
- [ ] Create parser tests in `parser_tests.zig` for all syntax features
- [ ] Develop interpreter tests in `interpreter_tests.zig`
- [ ] Add integration tests for full program execution
- [ ] Create benchmarks to measure performance

---

# Documentation

- [ ] Complete the language specification in `language_spec.md`
- [ ] Write a beginner-friendly tutorial in `tutorial.md`
- [ ] Document all built-in functions and their usage
- [ ] Create code examples with explanations for common patterns
- [ ] Add inline code documentation for maintainability

---

# Example Programs
